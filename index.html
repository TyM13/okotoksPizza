        <p id="indexP_one">The secret to success is much like the secret to making a better pizza - the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. 
            Our pizza family is as hungry for perfection today as we were when we first opened our doors more than 30 years ago. And we're 
            driven to be the best at making innovative new products and recipes.</p>
        
        <p id="indexP_two">We know you have a lot of options when ordering pizza. 
        Okotoks Worlds Greatest Pizza stands behind our unique recipe, 
        which is a delicious combination of fresh ingredients, a bit of traditional style mixed in,
         and hand made quality that comes through with great taste
